            <p>
                Apache JMeter is a powerful open-source tool designed for load testing and performance measurement. It is widely used for testing web applications, APIs, and databases to ensure they can handle the expected load and perform efficiently under stress.
                <br><br>
                JMeter supports a variety of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. This makes it a versatile tool for testing different types of applications and services.
                <br><br>
                One of the key features of JMeter is its ability to simulate multiple users simultaneously, allowing developers to test the scalability and performance of their applications under real-world conditions.
                <br><br>
                JMeter's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear visualizations of test results. It also supports integration with other tools and platforms, such as Jenkins and Maven, making it a popular choice for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
